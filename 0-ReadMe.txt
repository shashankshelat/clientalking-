thought output image is there, i have attached shell output fill. Could be seen in notepad or text document.


NOTE:
I have completed the project in the Windows 7. 
This code works fine only on windows 7 without any setting change.


Problem Faced: (only in windows 8)
Need to be removed:
	Firewall
	changed User Account Control settings in windows 8
	Removed all antivirus and network blocking.

Attachemnt :
1) server code provided in book. modified by me
2) cilent code. Performed.
3) Out outputs.
4) A folder that consist of simple client and server ping and reply. which was futher modified for the RTT

4th was used to check the firewall setting and also for learing





Problem faced:

Error faced:
#recieves message from server error: [Errno 10054] 
An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host


while programming for the opetional code. I need to take a memory, which was getting out error as Index of bound.




solutions :

for the first one i had to manually close the Process Id from the Taskbar only in windows 8.

PID closes automatically in Windows 7, there I did not faced that problem in that.



Also I want to know for server and client, i opened 2 IDEL (python GUI) seperatly and ran the code.
But in windows 8 i can only open one IDEL(python GUI), then how should i run it on windows 8?
